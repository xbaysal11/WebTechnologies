		<p>I appreciated <u>Frankenstein's Cat</u> for its fascinating explanation about the often baffling subject of bioengineering and its sister sciences. <u>Emily Anthes</u> explains the many sides of today's modern technology, such as gene modification, cloning, pharmaceutical products (from the farm), <b><i>prosthesis</i></b>, <b><i>animal</i></b> tag and tracking and gene cryogenics. This book provides a well-rounded summary of these complicated sciences <b><i>without being boring or simply factual.</i></b> Her real world examples take us on a journey from the farm, to the pet store and then from the pharmacy to the frozen arc.
